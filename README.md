## Day 1
  ### Preliminary Tasks
  This day starts out with learning some descriptions like:
  
    1. Design: The set of verilog codes which has necessary functionality to meet with the given specifications.
    2. Simulator: Tool used for simulating a design so that we can check if RTL Design matches with the given specifications.
    3. Test Bench: Setup to apply stimulus (test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality.
    
  Relevant github repositories (sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop, vsdflow) are first cloned<sup>a</sup> using the following command in a relevant directory:
  > git clone https://www.github.com/(insert_file_name)
  
  The repository "vsdflow" requires relevant tools for this workshop and "sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop" contains various pre-written verilog files and .lib file for understanding the design flow.
